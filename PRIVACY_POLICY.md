# Privacy Policy for Green Streak

**Last Updated: January 22, 2026**

## Overview

Green Streak ("the App") is a habit tracking application designed with privacy as a core principle. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Green Streak is designed to operate entirely on your device. We do not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Store any data on external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Require account creation
- Access your contacts, location, or other device data

## Data Storage

All data you create in Green Streak (habits, completions, settings) is stored locally on your device using SQLite. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted over the internet
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the app

## Third-Party Services

Green Streak does not integrate with any third-party services that collect data. The app does not make network requests.

## Widgets

Green Streak includes iOS widgets that display your habit data. Widget data is shared between the main app and widgets using Apple's App Groups feature, which keeps all data securely on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Green Streak does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
- Using a device passcode or biometric lock
- Keeping your device's operating system updated

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. Since we do not collect any data, significant changes to this policy are unlikely.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any of your personal data, there is no data for us to provide, modify, or delete. You have full control over your data through the app itself.
